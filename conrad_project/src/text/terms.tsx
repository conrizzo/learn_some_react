        <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            Section 1 <em>The Condiment Conundrum</em>
            <br></br>
            1.1. Upon entering this agreement, you relinquish all claims to the possession of a perfectly symmetrical ketchup packet. (Asymmetrical packets, however, are fair game for catapult construction.)
            1.2. You solemnly swear to never, ever ask for mayonnaise on a breakfast burrito. Such a transgression shall result in a mandatory ten-minute lecture on the virtues of salsa.
            1.3. Should you encounter a sentient pickle with a hankering for existential discussions, you are obligated to offer it a deep-fried conversation (onion rings, naturally) and ponder the meaning of life with a side of philosophical fries.
            1.4. All complaints regarding the existence of mystery meat in your mystery meat burger must be submitted in the form of a limerick featuring a disgruntled cow and a chorus line of dancing onions.
            1.5. In the event of a sudden milkshake avalanche (chocolate only, for structural integrity reasons), you are solely responsible for constructing a life raft out of discarded waffle fries.
        </p>

        <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            Section 2: <em>The Burger Ballad</em>
            <br></br>
            2.1. We reserve the right to replace all burger toppings with sprinkles at any given moment. Don&apos;t worry, ketchup sprinkles are still delicious (probably).
            2.2. Users are strictly forbidden from attempting to build a functioning jetpack out of used soda cups and leftover french fries. The potential for sticky disasters is simply too high.
            2.3. Should you discover a hidden compartment in your burger containing a miniature world populated entirely by sentient onion rings, you agree to maintain diplomatic relations and negotiate a trade treaty for the exchange of ketchup packets.
            2.4. In the case of a malfunction that results in your milkshake inexplicably transforming into a sentient disco ball, you are responsible for orchestrating a dance party with a minimum of three enthusiastic napkins.
            2.5. We strongly advise against attempting to convince the drive-thru employee that you are, in fact, a sentient spork disguised in a human trench coat. Confusion and raised eyebrows are likely to ensue.

            Section 2: <em>The Burger Ballad (Continued)</em>
            <br></br>
            2.6. In the highly unlikely event that a rogue singing chicken nugget attempts to serenade you with a soulful rendition of the &quot;Chicken McNugget Song,&quot; you are obligated to provide a standing ovation and a heartfelt critique focusing on the proper execution of a high C (with extra dipping sauce, of course).

            2.7. Users are expressly forbidden from using our services to train french fries to perform synchronized swimming routines in the soda fountain. The potential for soggy chaos and beverage contamination is simply too high.

            2.8. Should you discover a hidden message etched on the bottom of your soft drink cup, you agree to decipher it and, if it pertains to the secret recipe for the elusive &quot;McRib,&quot; share 20% of the first bite with us (in the form of a slightly used spork, naturally).

            2.9. In the case of a malfunction that results in your order being replaced entirely with a mountain of mystery meat patties, you are responsible for negotiating a peaceful resolution with a well-timed impersonation of Colonel Sanders performing the Macarena.

            2.10. We absolutely, positively prohibit any attempts to convince the milkshake machine that it is secretly harboring dreams of becoming a rockstar. Technical difficulties and existential meltdowns are a recipe for disaster (and a lack of delicious milkshakes).
